# CONTRIBUTING: Autestme Contribution Guide – Build the Neurodiverse Talent Ecosystem

Welcome, and thanks for your interest in contributing to **Autestme**.  
Autestme is a "Develop-to-Earn" (D2E) platform built **by and for neurodiverse talent**.  
We try to keep everything predictable, explicit and low-stress.

## 1. Project Overview

- **App**: iOS (SwiftUI) memory game (shapes, numbers, letters)

- **Goal**: reward contributors with *AutestCoin ($AUT)* and govern the project via a DAO

Right now we are in **early alpha**:
- Game + Web3 integration are under active development
